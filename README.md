This is a beautiful website using the NEOBRUTALISM DESIGN.



What is neo Brutalism in design?
Brutalism and Neo-Brutalism, will it be a new trend in 2023 ...
Neo-Brutalism is a design concept with an unusual background color theme without gradients,
modern typography, animation, and ugly elements. Neo-Brutalism refuses the usual components of UXUI design and
embraces uncomfortable design elements,
and it is more fearless to use distinctive color palettes.
